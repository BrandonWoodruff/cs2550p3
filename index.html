        <p>
          Lovo is a traditional Fijian cooking method that involves burying food in an underground oven. This communal style of cooking is often used for special occasions and gatherings. Meats, vegetables, and root crops are wrapped in banana leaves and placed on hot stones, creating a smoky, succulent feast.

          Kokoda is a popular Fijian dish similar to ceviche. It features raw fish (often mahi-mahi or tuna) marinated in lime or lemon juice, coconut cream, chili, and a mix of herbs and spices. The acid in the citrus juice "cooks" the fish, resulting in a refreshing and zesty dish.

        <p>
          Another coconut-based delight, palusami consists of taro leaves, onions, and coconut cream wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. The slow cooking process infuses the ingredients with a rich, velvety texture and a slightly sweet, nutty flavor.

          Kava, a traditional Fijian drink made from the roots of the kava plant, is widely consumed during social gatherings. It has a mildly sedative effect and is known for its earthy, slightly bitter taste. On the other hand, fresh fruit juices and coconut water are also popular choices for staying hydrated in the tropical climate.
